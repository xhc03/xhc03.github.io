I'm an aspiring researcher and engineer in my final year at **Beihang University**, driven by a mission to demystify the complex interplay between algorithms and the silicon they run on. My academic journey is centered around a core question: **How can we build more efficient, powerful, and perceptive hardware for the age of AI?** This question has led me to dive deep into the worlds of **FPGA/ASIC design, computer vision, and wireless sensing**.

<summary><strong>üîé Project 1: Rethinking Millimeter-Wave Object Detection (First Author, under review)</strong></summary>
<br>


<!-- Text-Image Layout: Image on the right -->

**The Challenge:** Standard object detectors fail in millimeter-wave security screening due to noisy backgrounds and faint, tiny targets. A fundamentally different approach was needed.

**My Approach:** I architected a multi-stage, "divide and conquer" detection pipeline. First, I used a Segmentation foundation model (SAM) to **surgically remove background clutter**. Then, I re-engineered the YOLOv8 architecture with custom **"Windmill Convolutions"** and a **"Monte Carlo Attention"** mechanism, forcing the network to focus on preserving the subtle features of minuscule targets.

**The Impact:** This novel framework boosted the core detection accuracy (**mAP50-95) by 6.84%** while simultaneously making the model leaner and faster, slashing **parameters by 45.85%**. This work was recognized with a university research award and is currently under review at *IEEE GRSL*.

<summary><strong>üì° Project 2: Sensing Human Activity with Wi-Fi Signals (First Author, IEEE ICSECE 2025)</strong></summary>
<br>


<!-- Text-Image Layout: Image on the right -->


**The Challenge:** Can we perceive human actions without cameras or wearables, using only the ambient Wi-Fi signals that already surround us? The difficulty lies in extracting meaningful patterns from these abstract, noisy signals.

**My Approach:** My core insight was to reframe the problem. Instead of analyzing the raw signal directly, I used Short-Time Fourier Transform (STFT) to convert the Wi-Fi Channel State Information (CSI) into **3D spectrograms**‚Äîessentially turning the signal into an "image" that reveals the micro-Doppler shifts caused by human movement. I then built a hybrid **CNN-BiLSTM network**. The CNN acts as a feature "eye," extracting spatial patterns from each spectrogram frame, while the BiLSTM models the sequence, understanding the grammar of motion over time.

**The Impact:** This method achieved **71.50% accuracy** on the public OPERAnet dataset, with F1 scores **exceeding 0.9** for dynamic activities like walking. It validates a powerful, privacy-preserving approach to human activity recognition.

<summary><strong>‚ö° Project 3: Adaptive Image Denoising on an FPGA (First Author, IEEE AUTEEE 2024)</strong></summary>
<br>


<!-- Text-Image Layout: Image on the right -->


**The Challenge:** Traditional image filters make a trade-off: remove noise but blur important details. I wanted to create a filter "smart" enough to know the difference.

**My Approach:** I designed and implemented, entirely in **Verilog**, a real-time denoising system with a two-level adaptive engine. The algorithm analyzes the local complexity of the image on-the-fly, applying strong smoothing to flat areas while delicately preserving edges and textures. The entire process was optimized for **parallel pipeline execution** on a PYNQ-Z2 FPGA.

**The Impact:** The hardware-accelerated system demonstrably outperformed static filters, achieving a superior **Structural Similarity (SSIM) index of 0.3804**. It runs in real-time using minimal resources (just **5.28% of LUTs**), proving its practicality for real-world applications.
