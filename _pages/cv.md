### Research Experience

**A Near-Field Millimeter-Wave Concealed Object Detection Algorithm** (Project Lead)  
*Advisor: Prof. Guolin Sun, Beihang University*, Oct 2024 – Present
*   Oversaw the end-to-end research pipeline to tackle the critical challenge of detecting micro-sized, low-contrast threats in noisy mmWave security images.
*   **Pioneered a "Foreground Focus" strategy**, leveraging the SAM foundation model to perform pre-detection segmentation, effectively eliminating background interference at the source.
*   **Engineered a lean, specialized network architecture** by replacing standard convolutions with custom "Windmill Convolutions" and introducing a "Monte Carlo Attention" mechanism to enhance the preservation of faint target signatures.
*   The resulting model achieved a **6.84% mAP50-95 improvement** over the YOLOv8n baseline while simultaneously **reducing parameters by 45.85%** and **GFLOPs by 20.02%**, proving superior accuracy and efficiency.

**Passive Wi-Fi Human Activity Recognition** (Independent Researcher)  
*Advisor: Prof. Yonghui Li, University of Sydney*, Apr 2025 – Jul 2025
*   Independently architected a novel deep learning framework to classify human activities using only passive Wi-Fi signals.
*   **Developed a key insight** to transform raw Channel State Information (CSI) into rich 3D time-frequency spectrograms, converting an abstract signal problem into a concrete spatio-temporal analysis task.
*   **Constructed a hybrid CNN-BiLSTM model** that first extracts spatial patterns from each spectrogram "frame" via CNN, then models their temporal evolution using BiLSTM, holistically capturing activity dynamics.
*   Achieved **71.50% accuracy** on the public OPERAnet dataset, with **F1 scores exceeding 0.9** for dynamic motions, validating the framework's effectiveness for non-invasive sensing.

**Design of a Terahertz Metasurface for Molecular Sensing** (Independent Researcher)  
*Advisor: Prof. Cunjun Ruan, Beihang University*, Dec 2024 – Jan 2025
*   Led the design, simulation, and analysis of a Terahertz metasurface sensor in CST Microwave Studio.
*   **Demonstrated critical scientific thinking** by identifying and correcting a significant error in a reference publication, independently verifying my hypothesis through rigorous simulation and analysis.

**Spatio-Temporal Graph Neural Networks for Aviation Network Prediction** (Core Contributor)  
*Advisor: Prof. Wenbo Du, Beihang University*, Dec 2023 – Jul 2024
*   Co-architected an STGCN model to forecast flight delays by treating the national aviation network as a dynamic graph, capturing previously ignored spatial dependencies.
*   My contributions helped the model achieve a **transformative 88% reduction in Mean Absolute Error** compared to the LSTM baseline (from 238.88 down to 28.56), showcasing the power of graph-based approaches.

### Industry Experience

**ASIC Design and Verification Intern**  
*Phytium Technology (A leading Chinese CPU vendor)*, Jul 2024 – Aug 2024
*   Dissected the complete industrial ASIC design lifecycle and **authored a 41-page internal technical report** that became a reference for new team members.
*   **Engineered a parameterizable asynchronous FIFO** using Verilog, implementing a robust Gray Code-based clock domain crossing (CDC) scheme to ensure data integrity.
*   Performed manual **Static Timing Analysis (STA)**, accurately calculating setup/hold slacks for a critical path, a task that earned commendation from my mentor.
*   Conducted a forward-looking analysis on the **CXL 3.0 protocol**, presenting its potential impact on future data center architectures to the team.
